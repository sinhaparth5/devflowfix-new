# DevFlowFix Automated Solution

## Incident Details
- **Incident ID**: inc_sample123456
- **Failure Type**: Build Failure
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript linting errors in the 'useProducts.ts' file caused the GitHub Workflow to fail due to an unused variable.
- **Confidence**: 92%
- **Timestamp**: 2025-12-25T09:55:14.811988

## Recommended Fix

### Description
Remove unused variable 'productId' from the useProducts hook. The variable was declared but never used in the component, causing ESLint to fail the build process. This is a common code quality issue that can be safely fixed by removing the unused declaration.

### Steps to Apply
1. Open the file `src/hooks/useProducts.ts`
2. Locate the unused variable declaration on line 15
3. Remove the line `const productId = props.id;` or use the variable in your component logic
4. Run `npm run lint` to verify the fix
5. Commit and push the changes

### Additional Information
- **Estimated Time**: 5 minutes
- **Risk Level**: LOW

## Prevention Measures

### Enable Pre-commit Hooks
Set up ESLint to run automatically before commits to catch these issues early. Add husky and lint-staged to your project to enforce code quality checks before code reaches CI/CD.

### Configure IDE Linting
Enable real-time ESLint feedback in your code editor (VSCode, WebStorm, etc.) to catch unused variables as you type, preventing them from being committed in the first place.

### Update CI/CD Pipeline
Add a dedicated linting step early in your CI/CD pipeline to fail fast on code quality issues, saving time and resources by catching problems before running expensive build and test steps.
